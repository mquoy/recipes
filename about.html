		<p>This site was done as part of the Odin Project's intro to HTML/CSS/Javascript. I tweaked it on my own outside of the main course. This webpage is the end product.</p>

		<p>For this project, I wanted to keep the design simple and elegant. The color scheme felt fitting for the light-hearted nature of this page. There are only a few example recipes right now, though I'd like to continue adding to this site. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
