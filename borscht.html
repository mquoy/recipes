	<h2>The Perfect Cold Weather Soup</h2>
	<p>It is that time of year again: the leaves are changing, the winds are growing cooler, and winter seems just around the corner. Few meals compliment chillier weather than hearty, delicious soups. A Ukranian (and Slavic in general) favorite, borscht is fun to make and even more fun to eat. Plus, borscht is packed with vegetables, making it a healthy option.</p>

	<p>Not all borscht soups are created the same. Many traditional styles of borscht refrain from using meat. But for those occasions when you want a little <em>more</em> in your soup, try this borscht with beef recipe adapted from <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/borscht-recipe-with-meat/">Natasha's Kitchen</a> and suited to my own tastes (be sure to check out her site as it is a wonderful resource of amazing recipes).</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul class="ingredients">
		<li>0.5 to 1 lb Beef, depending on how much meat you want</li>
		<li>14 cups cold water</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp salt (add more to taste)</li>
		<li>2 large beets, washed, peeled, grated</li>
		<li>4 Tbsp olive oil</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp vinegar</li>
		<li>1 1/4 Tbsp sugar</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp tomato sauce or paste</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
		<li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
		<li>2 carrots, grated</li>
		<li>3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
		<li>1/2 head of cabbage, sliced</li>
		<li>2 tomatoes, peeled and diced</li>
		<li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
		<li>1/4 tsp group pepper</li>
		<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Garnish with sour cream and sprigs of parsley or dill.</p>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Start by washing the beef in cold water. Cut into 1-2" bite-sized cubes. Add to a big pot. Add the 14 cups of water and 1 Tbsp of salt. Bring the water to a boil. Once the water is at a boil, lower the heat, cover part of the pot, and cook for about an hour.</li>

		<li>Use a food processor to grate the beats into an ideal stringiness. If you don't have a food processor, use a grater. Put the sliced beats in a pan. Add 4 Tbsp of olive oil and 1 Tbsp of vinegar. Cook for 5 minutes, lower the heat to just below medium. Throw in 1 Tbsp of sugar and 2 Tbsp of tomato sauce. Stir around and cook down until the ingredients are nice and soft. Take the beets out of the pan and put in a bowl to rest.</li>

		<li>Saute the onion in 1 Tbsp of butter for a couple of minutes. Add the carrot (grated) and sautee for 5 more minutes or however long it takes for them to be soft.</li>

		<li>Let the meat cook for 45 minutes or so. Once this is done, put the potatoes (sliced) into the your pot. Cook for 10-12 minutes. Add the rest of the vegetables now: cabbage, the sauteed beets, onion, carrot, and tomatoes. Cook all of this together for another 10-12 minutes.</li>

		<li>Toss in the bay leaves and the pepper. Taste the broth. You'll know if you want to add more salt or not. This is entirely up to personal taste. I did not add extra salt, but my taste buds are sensitive!</li>

		<li>Chop up the parsley and garlic. Add them to the pot, cover, and move the pot away from the heat (don't forget to turn off the burner). Now the soup should sit and cook down for about 20-30 minutes. I found 30 minutes to be the sweet spot for my attempt, though this may change depending on your own adaptation.</li>

		<li>Enjoy your beautiful, delicious creation!</li>

		<li>While I was in Russia, I tried borscht for the first time. I added sour cream to my borscht at the insistence of my host, a concept I initially found strange but soon came to absolutely love. You can garnish your soup with the dill, if you want it to look extra nice. And <em>voila</em>.</li>
