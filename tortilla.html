				<h1>Not Your Average Tortilla</h1>
				<p>When most of us here in the United States think of the word "tortilla" we imagine the delicious bread often used as wraps, borritos, and soft tacos. But this recipe shifts that perspective back to Spain, where the tortilla is almost like an omelet. This fun recipe involved flipping a large omelet-type creation and shouting obscenities if all goes to pot.</p>

				<p>This recipe for the Spanish tortilla is not difficult. The flavors are rich as this includes veggies, eggs, and even meat if you desire. Prep and cooking time totals to around 20 minutes making this a great choice for a quick snack, a breakfast omelet replacer, or an entire meal for a culturally diverse dinner.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul class="ingredients">
		<li>1-2 medium potatoes</li>
		<li>Olive oil</li>
		<li>1 onion</li>
		<li>1 green bell pepper</li>
		<li>4-6 eggs</li>
		<li>Optional salt and black pepper</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Wash and peel the potatoes and onion in cold water. Wash the green bell pepper.</li>
		<li>Heal olive oil in a pan set to medium-high heat.</li>
		<li>Once heated, set to low, add potatoes. Cook until the potatoes begin to soften.</li>
		<li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Make sure they are nice and mixed.</li>
		<li>Add onions and bell peppers to the bowl of beaten eggs. Stir together and pour into the pan of potatoes.</li>
		<li>Let this all cook until you have a nice scrambled, omelet consistency going.</li>
		<li>Flip and cook the other side until done. There should be a nice browning on the eggs as seen in the photo above.</li>
		<li>Taking the pan <em>very</em> carefully, place a large circular baking sheet or other solid fitting surface over the pan. Flip the pan over to remove the beautiful Spanish tortilla. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.</li>
